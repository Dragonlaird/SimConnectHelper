# SimConnectHelper

A static class to simplify communication with MSFS 2020 using SimConnect.

Allows a project to connect to MSFS 2020, via SimConnect, and submit requests for SimVars.

MSFS 2020 may be running on the local PC, or on a remote PC.

Can connect via TCP/IP, if running on a remote PC, if the remote PC firewall is configured to allow remote connections and the SimConnect.xml file is configured to accept them.
